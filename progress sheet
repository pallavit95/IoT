Done so far:
	
	Verified all hardware on the breadboard and initialized the following:
	
	ESP 32 
		- communication between ESP32 - Cloud (console fetch on cloud using mqtt)

	ESP-EYE
		- ESP-WHO example for cat detection using xtensa libraries executed / displayed on web using wifi modules
		
	Cloud setup 
		- S3


Pending (Known)
	Cloud setup
		- Deployment (Lambda, EC2)

	Fish Detection Classifier (Haar classifer, YOLO-preferred)
		- Dataset (Niall,Yue - by 21st Feb, priority 1)
			- positive + bounding boxes
			- negative 
		- ESPEYE cpp/py executable code (Niall,Yue - by 21st Feb, priority 2)
		- Classifier model code in py
		- integrating above and running on ESPEYE
		{ 
			Fish Position Classifier
				- Dataset
					- positive + bounding boxes
					- negative 
				- ESPEYE cpp/py executable code
				- Classifier model code in py
				- integrating above and running on ESPEYE
		}

	ESP-EYE to Cloud connection (Pallavit,Juan - by 21st Feb, pr1)

	Cloud to ESP 32 connection (Pallavit,Juan - by 21st Feb, pr1)

	ESP32 to Acutator connection ()


Open Discussion Items (Unknowns):

	Actuator 
		- currently monitoring water level in aquarium
		- motor?
		- 3d printed arm?

	Confirmation from Prof for esp-eye and esp32 connection  (Yue)
		- currently esp-eye to cloud, then cloud to esp-32 , but do we need wires/soldering to connect espeye and 32?


	Scheduled based water level data sent to cloud
		- 
	
	Decision making system on cloud 
		- 
		
	Cloud Deployment environment (EC2/Lambda) (Shritesh)

	Cloud to Game overlay (Shritesh)
		- UI
