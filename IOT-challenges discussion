IOT

Updates: Pal
	1. hardware
		- Keep in central cloud repo and ask customer to download updates and flash it on the componenet
			- Check if componenets can be updated with new code wirelessly as well
		- 3d prinitng was used, how do we handle and scale those componenets?
	2. software	
		- cloud software updates
		
		

Scale: Yue
	1. Hardware
		- Adding a tempature sensor sticker 
		- Production of hardware devices in large numbers
		- Different aquarium sizes

	2. Software
		- Distribution of workload
			- Lambda (1000 concurrent reqs at a time / free tier)
				- auto-scale
			- S3 bucket 
				- partitions (3000-6000 actions per partition which is inside one bucket)
		- Geo-replication and server distribution
			- serving requests using servers that are closer to the user's location for low latency (AWS)
		- Different fish species but our model is trained on one fish currently



Security: Juan
	1. hardware
		- turn off motor in case of no wifi connection to get update from cloud as fail-safe mechanism

	2. software
		- implement encryption for photos
		- implement a forced change of password on first time setup
		- implement an auth protocol to authorize user in esp32
		- pass wifi details dynamically at first time setup
		- implement fail-safe on buttons geeting pressed and misbhevaiour (fish does credit card purchase)
		- use secure boot to check if running authorized software
		- all software patches are up to date

Power: Niall
	1. hardware
		- turning off the camera vs leaving it on
		- minimize esp32 board (sleep mode?), until it's triggered 
		- If water image level per time taken mismatch then turn off water pump 
		- check battery voltage by putting capacitor between power source and components like esp32 board / cam / motor
			to check if some threshold power value is met. Else power on an ideicator led
		- Turn off the motor after use 
		-

	2. software
		- check if fish is moving or same button is getting pressed X no of times to optimize no of pictures being sent to cloud (by updating from 5 sec to 30 sec for eg) / camera drawing power
